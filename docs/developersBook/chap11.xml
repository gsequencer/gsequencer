  <title>Thread-safe audio ports</title>
  <para>
    The AgsPort object provides you a well defined API to safe read or write
    data to the AgsPort. Its access is protected by mutices. All actions on
    ports shall happen through ::safe-read, ::safe-write, ::safe-get-property or
    ::safe-set-property.
  </para>

  <para>
    AgsPort can contain various data types. But of only one type at the time.
    Automation happens by adjusting ports and perhaps even applying an
    AgsConversion. Further it contains some meta-information about plugin name
    and port specifier.
