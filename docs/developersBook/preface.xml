    I began to code with C in spring 2002 and hadn't much programming skills, yet.
    You may ask me why the C programming language? Well, my friend who was already
    a convient free software user and hacker recomended me it. He told me that C is
    a standard on Unix like operating systems so it would be a good choice.

    After started with language basics and several discussions with my friend about
    pointers he advised me of Gtk+. While I was doing my first steps in GUI programming
    with C, I was sure to extensively use it and became a persuaded free software user
    and programmer.

    A year later I really understood the object orientated matter of GObject and how
    to write objects and widgets myself. C wasn't like Java where you just couldn't
    implement no classes just everything was a class or at least a method.

    First output with AGS happend via Open Sound System device drivers but the entire
    application lacked of a thread safe concept. But for now you may write tasks.
