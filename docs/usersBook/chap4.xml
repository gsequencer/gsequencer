  <para>
    With the navigation you have overall control of your song. Settings you perform
    here may influence the behaviour of AGS. There's a duration label doing a time approximation.
    It is really unreliable and may differ about 30 seconds after 3 minutes of playback. Note
    with higher frequency of the audio related threads it may differ less. An other factor is bpm
    what has an influence, as well.
  </para>

    <title>BPM</title>
    <para>
      The beats per minute (BPM for short) indicates the velocity of a song being
      played. To adjust the BPM of the project in-/decrement the spinner labeled
      with bpm. To edit patterns or notes at a more granular rate select the wished
      tact within the appropriate engine or editor.
    </para>
    <para>
      To calculate timings you divide 1 minute with the entered BPM and divide it
      with basic. For example you have a BPM rate of 120 and a 4/4 tact you would
      calculate the timing as follow:
    </para>
    <equation>
      <mathphrase>t = 1 / 120 * (1 / 4)</mathphrase>
    </equation>

      With these controls you can play/stop a song or seek to the wished position.

      The loop checkbox enables the loop L and loop R settings below. It causes the notation to loop playback.
      Auto-Scroll checkbox animates the horizontal scrollbars to follow playback position. Use exclude sequencers
      checkbox to enable/disable pattern based sequencers.
